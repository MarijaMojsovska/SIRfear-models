# SIRfear-models
(Final project for the course *Life Data Epidemiology*)

Introducing age groups and different types of contacts (in person and online) to the SIRf models and  simulation of possible public health interventions

Goals:
- Build models to simulate an SIR epidemic including the spreading of the fear
- Analyze how the spreading of the fear can affect the epidemic evolution
- Include in the model a division in classes by age, considering different matrices for face-to-face and online average daily number of contacts
- Study the trend of the epidemic for the different groups
- Hypothesize some measures to contain the epidemic and understand their impact
